3. Get your API key and Project ID from the service credentials

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your credentials
IBM_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
IBM_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id_here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Test the Integration

```bash
python -c "from utils.ai_assistant import AIAssistant; ai = AIAssistant(); print('✅ IBM Granite ready!')"
```

## 🔄 Fallback System

The system automatically falls back to Groq if IBM Granite is unavailable:

```
